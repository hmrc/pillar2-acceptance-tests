  Scenario: 1 - Verify RFM corporate position page and validations
    Given Organisation User logs in as upe for Pillar2
    And I access RFM corporate position page
    Then I should be on RFM Corp Position Page
    And The caption must be Replace filing member
    And The Heading should be What is your position in the corporate structure of the group?
    And The hint text should be To replace the existing filing member for this account you must have access to the information required to report Pillar 2 top-up taxes on the groupâ€™s behalf.
